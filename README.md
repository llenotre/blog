My blog.



## Configuration

Configuration is done through environment variables. The following variables are being used:
- `BLOG_PORT`: The port on which the HTTP server listens
- `BLOG_DISCORD_INVITE`: The URL of the invitation to the Discord server
- `BLOG_ARTICLE_PATH`: The path to the blog article directory
- `BLOG_ARTICLE_ASSETS_PATH`: The path to the blog article assets directory

The configuration for the [Gateway API](https://github.com/llenotre/gateway) is also required.
